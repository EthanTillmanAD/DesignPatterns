public class Proxy {
    /*
    pattern that acts as an interface to something else
    typically used when an interceptor to interact between two objects

    best to used when wanting to wrap a real object with a proxy
    needs and interface to an object
    can add functionality to the wrapped object
    cam solve multiple problems like security simplicity remote and cost
    its called to access the real object
    many frameworks are built with a proxy

    typically interfaced based
    sits between implementation class and interface

    pitfalls would be can only have one proxy/instance
    adds another abstraction layer
    similar to other patterns

    can add functionality but not its main purpose
    only one
    great utilities built into java api




    Examples:
    java.lang.reflect.Proxy
    java.rmi.*
